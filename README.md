 # Email Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying emails as spam or not using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Feature extraction techniques such as TF-IDF and Bag of Words are employed to preprocess the email data.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
- **src/**: Source code for the project.
- **results/**: Results and model evaluation metrics.

## Feature Extraction
The project utilizes two main feature extraction techniques:
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** Measures the importance of words in documents.
- **Bag of Words (BoW):** Represents text data by counting the frequency of words.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
Two machine learning algorithms are employed for classification:
- **Logistic Regression:** A linear model used for binary classification.
- **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees.
